I am a part time student expecting to graduate in May 2019. I am from PEI but I've lived in Halifax for 12 years. My education background is math and electrical engineering. My work experience is as technical product manager, a financial trader, and a previous owner of two businesses.  I am currently working on a project with Atlantic Lotto Corporation to analyze their customer transaction data. I have some experience with Python. I have some exposure to C, C++, Java, PHP, SQL, html, git, and OOP as a concept. I am interested in the tech of processing and analyzing real-time data streams.
