General Notes:

- Gained further insight into general Java principles and code structure. For example, in this assignment I separated the logger initialization code into it's own Class. 
- I learned how to use the Eclipse debugger and saw the importance of this tool in aiding with roadblocks
 
Code Notes:
- The program does implement the 'Required Methods' successfully.
- Does not yet include all validation code. For example does not properly check for special characters.
