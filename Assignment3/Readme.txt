Assignment 3
Duane Malone

Notes:
- The assignment consists of two separate project directories, one for the web service and one for the client. 
- I was able to refactor the assignment 2 code to use proper Java packaging and singleton implementation. 
- I was able to install Tomcat9 and run the webservice. I included a simple number addition method to test the service/client call in a basic manner. 
- I was able to create a client and call the simple addition method (addFloat()) and print the result to the Client console. 
- I was able to make a call to the Trxn function in the web service but encountered errors in trying to get the web service to return the data back to the client. 
- As this is where I got stuck, I was unable to test the assignment on the linux server.
