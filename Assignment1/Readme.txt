Assumptions:
- I assumed any row with a missing cell value is INVALID

Logfile output:
- For each file that is read I output: 
     - The number of records
     - The number of good records
- At the end I log the execution time, the total files read, and the number of valid and invalid records.

NOTE: The output formatting got messed up in Linux somehow?
